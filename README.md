# Text Encryption

---

## Algorithms Used

**The algorithm that will be used initially for this project will be Autokey Cipher** 

---

## Why I'm Making This Application

I would like to gain a deeper understanding of the algorithms that go into encryption and cryptography. I take an immense interest in 
cybersecurity and security research outside of development and to learn implementation of cybersecurity elements within development is 
something I'm very interested in. This for me is a stepping stone to eventually be able to develop tooling and other things that I and other people can use for security research.

## Task List To Start

[ ] Start With HTML

[ ] Style With CSS

[ ] Implement Reading Data From a Form 

[ ] Push That Data From One Form to a Seperate One After Being Encrypted

[ ] Implement Input Form Validation and Other Securities As I Build The Application Further

[ ] Have A Select Drop Down That Allows You To Change Algorithm You Want To Use

## Algorithms To Be Added
*Caesar Cipher* 

*Vigenere Cipher* 

*Railfence Cipher*  

*Playfair Cipher*

## Possible Future Implementation

There is a possibility that I will become extremely engaged and really wanting to take this project to the nedxt level as it is something I am passionate about. 

### Future Implementation May Include

**Image Encryption**
